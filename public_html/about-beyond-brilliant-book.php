 <p><strong>Beyond Brilliant&rsquo;s recipes are split up into sections for the purpose of the book chapters which are as follows:</strong></p>

 <p><strong>A BRILLIANT STUDENT AND TEACHER</strong>- in this section, you will find recipes Dipna regularly teaches at universities and colleges, some great Indian specialities such as home-made paneer and Dipna&rsquo;s special Alu Phal Chaat</p>


 <p><strong>THE BRILLIANT RESTAURANT</strong>- in this section, you will find authentic and traditional recipes, most of which date back to the 1950&rsquo;s and were inventions of Dipna&rsquo;s Grandfather. You will also find new creative innovations to the Brilliant menu, including tandoori delights such as Tandoori Lamb Chops and mouth watering Malai Tikka.
</p>

 <p><strong>THE BRILLIANT FAMILY</strong>- in this section, Dipna showcases some wonderful recipes taught to her by her mum together with her award winning recipes and own favourites.</p>

Dipna has dedicated a section of her book to her brother&rsquo;s wedding which she organised in February 2014 where she not only carried out all the organisation of the wedding event but also came up with a menu which was nothing less than Brilliant. Recipes such as Makhani Chicken, Kasta Samosas and Kheer in this chapter are some of the treats revealed in this section.</p>
