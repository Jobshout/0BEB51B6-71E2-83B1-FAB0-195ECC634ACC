              <h2>Brilliant Restaurant Profile</h2>
              <p><strong>Dipna Anand (Author of Beyond Brilliant)  tells you more about her family run restaurant located in West London:</strong></p>
              <p>The Brilliant Restaurant is located in old Southall and specialises in North Indian Punjabi cuisine with a Kenyan slant. Currently The Brilliant has 250 seats and boasts a Banqueting Suite for 120 guests. Brilliant also operates an Outdoor Catering Service for specialist events. </p>

 <p><img src="images/brilliant_restaurant_charles.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-left thumbnail no-float" style="margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:0px;"> The Brilliant Restaurant is located on Western Road and opened in 1975, although its background represents 150 years of catering experience and expertise. The first Brilliant Restaurant, Hotel and Nightclub opened in Kenya (Nairobi) in the early fifties. The Brilliant establishments in Kenya were opened by Bishen Dass Anand who was known to be the King of all Chefs during that time in Africa. Bishen Dass groomed his sons in the running of the Restaurant business and they worked hard alongside their father to learn all needed to run a successful business. Soon after the loss of their father, the family moved to Southall in West London and two of Bishen Dass&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s, Gulu and Kewal Anand decided to re-launch The Brilliant Restaurant in London where they were proud to carry on the &lsquo;Brilliant&rsquo; name, tradition and recipes. The Brilliant started off as a 36 seat restaurant when it opened 37 years ago and ever since has extended several times in both size and reputation as the business has grown organically.</p>

 <p> The food served at The Brilliant is authentic North Indian Punjabi food with Kenyan influences also seen on the menu and each of the dishes has a unique flavour, taste and texture and is cooked to perfection. At the heart of the business is devotion to authentic, fresh and superbly prepared food. The Management and staff do everything they can to ensure that those who chose to dine at the restaurant have a &lsquo;Brilliant&rsquo; time. That often means doing immensely more than simply cooking.</p><p><img src="images/hall.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right thumbnail" style="margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:0px;">The motive of the restaurant is not just to serve the customer, but to ensure the customer leaves with a smile, happy and satisfied with one thought in mind &ldquo;we shall be back at The Brilliant very soon&rdquo;. Customer at the Brilliant, are more than just diners, when they come to the restaurant, they become part of the &lsquo;Brilliant&rsquo; family. This together with the high standards of food is what keeps guests coming back.</p>

 <p>On numerous occasions the Brilliant Management team has been asked to open branches in various parts of London and also abroad. Although it is felt the Brilliant would be extremely successful if this route was taken, this route has not been taken for one simple reason. If customers want to come to The Brilliant, they shall travel the distance and make the effort to visit no matter how far the Brilliant is, because The Brilliant is now known to be an institution in Southall.</p>
 <p><img src="images/family.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-left thumbnail" style="margin-right:15px; margin-bottom:0px;"> The Brilliant is a family run establishment which is now in its third generation. Gulu&rsquo;s (Chairman) children, Dipna and Shanker are now the forefront of the business, eagerly brining in new concepts, ideas and innovations. After Brilliant&rsquo;s success on Channel 4&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ramsay&rsquo;s Best Restaurant&rsquo; series, where the restaurant was voted as one of &lsquo;Ramsay&rsquo;s Best&rsquo; and after being visited by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, the popularity of the Brilliant has risen to new heights resulting in greater customer demand within the restaurant itself and Outdoor Catering services provided for by the company. Recently The Brilliant restaurant has launched the new venture of offering Indian cookery courses which take place on the weekends and these are proving to be extremely popular. The cookery courses are recognised by The University of West London and are described as customers to be fun, exciting and informative.</p> 

 <p>The Brilliant has won The British Curry Award for <strong>&lsquo;Best Indian Restaurant in London suburbs&rsquo;</strong> for 4 consecutive years and has also been awarded a special award from The Good Food Guide. The Brilliant can be found in all major food guides and is often reviewed by National and International Magazines and newspapers.</p>
 <p>Brilliant&rsquo;s reputation circulates among British Monarchy, Bollywood and Hollywood, Politicians and Industrialists to name but a few. Brilliant success is due to creating tastes of the palette which have delighted generations from all over the world. We look forward to welcoming and delighting you also and hope you enjoy cooking with Dipna in the <strong><a href="about-beyond-brilliant-book.php">&lsquo;BEYOND BRILLIANT&rsquo;</a></strong> cookbook.</p>
