                     <p>Producing a book about Westminster Kingsway College, where I currently serve as head of faculty for hospitality and culinary arts, has long been an ambition of mine. I wanted it to be a fitting tribute to this great college &ndash; its 100-year history, its famous former students and the amazing facilities and teaching staff found here today. Having already authored many academic text books, I&rsquo;m no stranger to the world of publishing &ndash; but this was something else entirely.</p>

<p>Thank goodness, then, for RMC Books. They handled everything, creating a product that was well-written, beautifully designed and full of stunning photography. What&rsquo;s more, their careful project management ensured that every little detail was taken care of, just the way we wanted it.</p>

<p>The finished book not only met our expectations but exceeded them, garnering rave reviews and high praise from all corners of the industry. More importantly, it will serve as a unique and highly effective marketing tool for our brand.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in recommending RMC Books &ndash; a team of true professionals, and thoroughly nice people to boot.</p>

                      <p>This is a great way to market your business. Every book I have seen from RMC Books has been so well put together, your customers can&rsquo;t fail but to be impressed.&rdquo;</p>

                     <p> When we first considered the idea of producing our own cookbook, we were anxious about the amount of time it would absorb. And all for what we thought would be little if any financial return.

I am glad to say we were wrong on both counts.</p>

<p>The team at RMC Books guided us every step of the way, and their service covered everything &ndash; from production to press relations through to getting us in the bookshops. But above all, the monetary returns exceeded even our most optimistic hopes.</p>

<p>The first book sold out four print runs. In 2009 we commissioned RMC Books to produce our all-new second cookbook. As with its predecessor, we have enjoyed massive exposure for the brand and a pleasing profit performance, even in these difficult times.</p>
<p>We look forward to the publication of our third book with RMC Books.</p>
