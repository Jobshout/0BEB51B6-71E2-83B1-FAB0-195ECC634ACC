           <p>   <strong>Dipna Anand is an Indian cookery guru</strong> who has been on the brink of creating new and exciting Indian healthy recipes which she has also put on the menu at her father&rsquo;s award-winning restaurant in Southall, The Brilliant. Her A-Level food technology project on low-fat Indian cookery earned her top marks and won her a National award from The British Nutrition Foundation as the best project in the country.</p>

<p> Dipna then studied and gained a first-class honours degree in Hospitality and Catering from The University of West London (formally known as Thames Valley University) and was awarded a post-graduate scholarship. During her scholarship, she began teaching Indian cuisine at the university and soon started lecturing in Catering and Hospitality in 4 colleges and university establishments in and around London which she still carries out today.
</p>
<p> Recently Dipna won an award which was announced by the Prime Minister at The British Curry award function in Battersea Park for recognition and contribution to the industry, she is delighted with this honour and says the award has motivated her to strive further and continue climbing the success ladder.</p>

<p> Apart from being a Chef Lecturer and Lecturer in Catering and Hospitality, Dipna is very much part of her father&rsquo;s restaurant business and helps in the day to day running of the company assisting customers, dealing with requests, devising new recipes, managing admin restaurant duties and carrying out new improvements and innovations to take the restaurant to even more superior heights. </p>

<p> Dipna&rsquo;s has also ventured out into the product manufacturing market and assisted her father in bottling a range of specialist chutneys and pickles made at the restaurant. The product recipes date back to over 60 years and are now available to customers for purchasing. Dipna&rsquo;s latest venture is the launch of her cookery courses which started in October 2012. Customers passionate to learn how to cook food just like that offered in Brilliant are now able to take cookery classes at the restaurant on weekends during the afternoon, where they are minded by chef Dipna and also given an insight on the spices used in Punjabi cuisine. </p>
<p> <strong>Dipna believes the secret for her success is hard work, passion and dedication and a &lsquo;can do&rsquo; attitude in tasks she carries out. </strong>She encourages youngsters to pursue careers in the catering and hospitality industry and feels strongly about the fact that the food industry in the UK needs skilled staff including Managers and Chefs to further increase the success of hospitality and Catering especially in our much loved curry industry. Dipna has watched her father&rsquo;s successes over the 38 years that the restaurant has been running and says she wants to make her father even more proud of her and will continue to work hard to take her the business even further. </p>

<p> Her father&rsquo;s restaurant, The Brilliant has won the British Curry Award for 4 consecutive years and has been voted as Ramsay&rsquo;s Best Restaurant for the Channel 4 series. Prince Charles has visited the restaurant twice and it is regularly frequented by many VIPS and celebrities.</p>
<p> <strong>Dipna is set to be the woman to transform the perception of Indian food as going hand-in-hand with healthy food.</strong> &ldquo;My mission is to raise the profile of Indian food as healthy food and also to show how quick, easy and simple Indian food really is to make. I believe that to be successful in this sector you need two things, it&rsquo;s quite a simple formula, passion plus dedication is equal to success and rewards&rdquo;.
Dipna has recently been approached by a production company to start her own TV cookery show and is looking forward to teach the nation how to cook REAL Indian food.</p>
